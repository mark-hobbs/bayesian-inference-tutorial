### A tutorial on Bayesian inference to identify material parameters in solid mechanics

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to recreate the examples published in the following paper ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-018-09311-x)):

### Paper abstract

The aim of this contribution is to explain in a straightforward manner how Bayesian inference can be used to identify material parameters of material models for solids. Bayesian approaches have already been used for this purpose, but most of the literature is not necessarily easy to understand for those new to the field. The reason for this is that most literature focuses either on complex statistical and machine learning concepts and/or on relatively complex mechanical models. In order to introduce the approach as gently as possible, we only focus on stress–strain measurements coming from uniaxial tensile tests and we only treat elastic and elastoplastic material models. Furthermore, the stress–strain measurements are created artificially in order to allow a one-to-one comparison between the true parameter values and the identified parameter distributions.

### Example problems

There are four examples and accompanying notebooks to further explain the core concepts:

1) Linear Elasticity
2) Linear Elasticity-Perfect Plasticity
3) Linear Elasticity-Linear Hardening
4) Linear Elasticity-Nonlinear Hardening

- Bayesian inference
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    - Standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
    - The adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
- Posterior Predictive Distribution (PPD)
- Noise in both stress and strain
- Model uncertainty
